Bayesian STreaming Record Linkage

This package performs streaming record linkage. We assume that files containing records about entities arrive sequentially in time. Each file is duplicate-free, 
but entities may be represented in more than one file. We want to determine, probabilistically, which records refer to the same entities across each file. We also want
these estimated links to be updated upon the arrival of each sequential file.
